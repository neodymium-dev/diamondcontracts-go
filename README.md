# diamondcontracts-go

Example(ish) Go wrappers and implementations around working with Diamond contracts and facets. 

There's a(n as of writing) barely functional example using ENSDiamond and its facets under [examples/ensdiamond](./examples/ensdiamond),
but it most definitely needs a lot of work. 

Pretty sure the UtilsFacet contract also needs to be rewritten _whoops_.
